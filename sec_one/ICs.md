An inegrated circuit is a miniature electronic circiuit consisting of various functional units, designed to perform a specific task or series of tasks.

Built by etching multiple electronic components (wires, transistors, resistors, capacitors, diodes) into a chip of semiconductor material. These components combine to build the functional units.

These are at the heart of modern computing, as their immaleable nature allows for TIGHT, borderline lossless, operation between it's components, performing an intricate dance which was carefully designed... this allows for low cost to manufacture (as they're standardized -> mass prod), more transistors per unit area, decreased power consumption (CMOS not common in discrete circuits?) and increased reliabiliy... the tradoff is less customization, and large value capacitors/resistors forbidden as blowing a component blows the whole circuit. Worth it!!!!!!! (usually)

In essense "ICs are just collections of transistors(and other electrical components) in a nice reliable package"
