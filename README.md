Execute geohot's pseudo-course to develop epic fundamental skillz.   
If all the mysteries of computing were contained within a tree, I aim to understand the leaf-nodes. Enabling me to interpolate back into the tree and meet 
up with my black-boxed knowledge--it will be easier to solve a mystery if my knowledge surrounds it, as opposed to attacking it from a single front. 
Ultimately, beyond the scope of this course, the tree will go from mostly dark, with pseudo-random pockets of light, to as illuminant as I can make it in 
my finite time.
