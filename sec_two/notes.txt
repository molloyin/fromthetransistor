Currently lost in the setup sauce a little.
In sec_two I'll be using QEMU to build the ARM7, and it's possible to implement sec_two in QEMU also.
Why not just use QEMU for everything? Learning icarus verilog or verilator would take time and be dumped immediatly...
then again, perhaps it will shallow out the learning curve to a worthwhile degree... will keep exploring!!! but need to do uni first :(( :D
